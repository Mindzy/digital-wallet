## Notice:

- **Packages used:**

  - networkx


- **Note**:

  Python version: 2.7.12
  
  Data files are not included in the repo.

  Method `feature()` is much quicker than `feature_nx_graph()` in feature 1 and feature 2, but quite slow while doing feature 3. Due to time limited for better user experience, I used `feature()` to complete feature 1 and 2, and used `feature_nx_graph()` to complete feature 3.

  Method feature_nx_graph() has used package `networkx`.

  Once run the program, it takes some minutes to create a dictionary for each feature. But tests for transactions are quick.
